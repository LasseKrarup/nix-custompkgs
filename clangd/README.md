# Clangd 21-init pre-release for Nix (ARCHIVED AND MOVED)

**This package has moved to [LasseKrarup/nix-custompkgs](https://github.com/LasseKrarup/nix-custompkgs)**

This is a Nix package containing a pre-release of `clangd` version "21-init" / "21.0.0.git".

Use this at your own risk. I have no freaking clue what I'm doing here,
I just really needed this new feature for embedded development:

```
CompileFlags:
  BuiltinHeaders: QueryDriver
```
